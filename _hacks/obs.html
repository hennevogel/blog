        A rich, wonderful case study that talks about my development process, my successes and failures, and my ultimate solutions.

      Big beautiful images look great, but they don’t tell a hiring manager if you can solve a problem. Can you design a solution
      that makes your users, clients, and stakeholders happy? Can you talk about your process — what solutions you tried, what worked,
      what didn’t, and why? Can you show heaps of work including prototypes, wireframes, scrapped visuals that shows your rigorous
      problem solving skills?
      </p>
      <p>
        Show that you can solve problems, and you’ll show that you’re worth hiring.
