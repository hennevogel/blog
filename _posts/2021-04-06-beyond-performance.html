<h2>Why build, not buy?</h2>
<p>
  But Henne, you say, there is already sentry, new relic, datadog, skylight and tons of other services that do this.
  Why build another one? Why reinvent the wheel?

      Because Free Software is an deeply evolutionary process. Free Software, just like Evolution, experiments all the time.
      Many experiments find their niche to exist. Some even go global. Linux, the largest install base of ALL operating
      systems on this planet. Wordpress powering an unbelievable 30% of the top 10 million websites. Mediawiki running the
      5th most popular site globally. But also, more than 98% of all projects on GitHub are not seeing any development beyond the first year they
  were created. Just like 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.

  We need to experiment and collaborate together. Evolution is what we do baby! ðŸ¤“
  We can't collaborate with any of those services. Can't run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve
  the software SaaS providers run. We can't scratch our itch, can't break it, learn how it works and make it
  better together, that's why.
