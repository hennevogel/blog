title: Mind the gap between platform and app
description: A blog post about preparing a Ruby on Rails app to be runnable on Platform as a Service providers such as Heroku
---
<p>
  With the Open Source Event Manager (OSEM), one of the <em>Ruby on Rails</em> apps I
  hack on, we're heading down the road to version 1.0. A feature we
  absolutely wanted to have, before making this step, was an easy deployment to at
  least one of the many <em>Platform as a Service</em> (PaaS) providers. We deemed this
  important for two reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Before people commit to use your precious little app they want to try it. And
    this has to be hassle free.
  </li>
  <li>
    Getting your server operating system ready to deploy Ruby on Rails applications can be
    tedious, too tedious for some people.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  So I have been working on making our app ready for <a
  href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> which is currently the most
  popular PaaS provider for rails (is it?). This was an interesting road, this
  is my travelogue.
</p>

<h2>Storage in the public cloud</h2>
<p>
  Storing files is incredibly easy in Rails, there are many ready made solutions
  for it like <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">paperclip</a>, <a
  href="https://github.com/markevans/dragonfly">dragonfly</a> or <a
  href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave">carrierwave</a>. The
  challenge with Heroku is, that on their free plan, your apps storage will be
  discarded the moment it is stopped or restarted. This happens for instance every
  time during a deployment or when the app goes to sleep because nobody is using
  it.
</p>
<p>
  And even though it's easy to store files in Rails, we in the OSEM team have long
  discouraged this in our app. We rather try to make it as easy as possible to
  reference things you have shared somewhere else. Want to show a picture of your
  Events location? Use the ones you share on flickr or instagram anyway. Embed a
  video of a Talk? Just paste the Youtube or Vimeo link. Share the slides with
  your audience? Slideshare or Speakerdeck to the rescue!

<p>
  Still there are some places left in our app where we upload pictures.
  Pictures we think conference organizers are not necessarily free to share on
  other platforms, like sponsor logos or pictures of sponsored lodgings. So to
  be able to use OSEM on Heroku our file upload needed support for offloading
  the files to someone else's computer a.k.a. *the cloud*. In the end I have
  settled for the carrierwave plug in of <a
  href="http://cloudinary.com/">cloudinary</a> (<a
  href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/970">pull request #970</a>).
</p>

<p>
  This means it's now as easy as configuring the <a
  href="https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_gem#configuration">cloudinary
  gem</A> and making use of their free plan to shove off all the storage OSEM
  needs to them.
</p>

<p>
  Storage was the first gap in OSEM that I closed, another piece of the puzzle was
  configuration.
</p>

<h2>Configuration in the environment</h2>
<p>
  According to <a href="http://12factor.net/config">some clever people</a> it's too easy to
  mistakenly check in your apps configuration file into your version control
  system. That's the reason your apps environment should provide all the settings.
  I'm <strong>not</strong> a big fan of putting stickers onto microwaves that say you can't use
  it to dry your cat. If people want to be stupid, let them.
</p>

<div class="img">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/frdn0r0hUXDTa/giphy.gif" alt="Someone being stupid." class="img-responsive img-rounded img-center">
</div>

<p>
  But hey 12-Factor is a thing, let's roll with it! So in <a
  href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/900">pull request #900</a> I
  removed all traces of OSEMs YAML configuration file and now all the settings
  happen in environment variables.
</p>

<p>
  This was the second gap I had to close to be able to run our app on Heroku. Now
  all of the sudden things where falling into place and some very interesting
  things emerged for OSEM.
</p>

<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
<p>
  One of the reasons I have gone down this road was to make it easy for people
  to try out OSEM. Now once you can run your app on Heroku you can also <a
  href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration">integrate your
  github repository</a> and run a continuous deployment (every commit get's
  deployed right away). That made it possible for us to set up an <a
  href="http://demo.osem.io/">OSEM demo instance</a> for people to try which
  always runs the latest code. All we had to do is to make use of data from our
  test suite to populate the demo (<a
  href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/pull/982">pull request #982</a>) and
  voila...
</p>

  </p>

<h2>Continuous Review</h2>
<p>
  So a continuous deployment of the latest code with some sample data. Does that
  sound useful for you as free software developer? I think being a free
  software developer first and foremost means collaborating with varying people
  from all over. People I work with on a daily basis and people who I never had
  contact with before. Collaboration mostly means reviewing each others changes
  to our code. It's pretty easy as we have <a
  href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-contribute">rules
  and tools</a> for that in place. What is not so easy is to do the same for
  changes to the functionality, the user experience design, of our app.
</p>
<p>
  In the OSEM team we some times attach a series of screenshots or animated gifs
  to a github pull requests to convey changes to the user interaction and work
  flows, but this is usually no replacement for trying yourself. Then in the
  middle of me doing all of this <a
  href="https://blog.heroku.com/heroku-review-apps-ga">Heroku
  Review Apps</a> happened. Review apps are instant, disposable deployments of
  your app that spin up automatically with each pull request.
</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Now, once someone sends a pull request where I want to review the user
  experience design I just press the 'Create Review App' button on Heroku and a
  minute later I get the a temporary instance populated with test data. Magic.
</p>

<h2>More things to come?</h2>
<p>
  Another thing we might want to replace in the future is how we spin up
  developer instances. So far we use <a
  href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#runing-osem-for-development">Vagrant</a>
  which starts your OSEM checkout in a virtual machine. But nowadays you have to
  have <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/docker">docker
  containers</a> in the mix right? Let's see what the future brings.
</p>
<p>
  All in all, I must say, it was a nice trip into the Platform as a Service
  world. Surprisingly easy to do and even more surprisingly rewarding for the
  development work flow. What do you think?
