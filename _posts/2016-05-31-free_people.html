title: Free Software is funded by Free People
description: A blog post about how Free Software projects are funded by
             collaboration between free people instead by money.

<p>
  More and more security incidents in Free Software projects get publicized in a
  way that anyone &amp; their grandma understand the impact. Some of these
  carefuly crafted "<a href="http://heartbleed.com/">campaigns</a>" even make it
  to the main stream media. This trend, among other things, has sparked a
  discussion about funding Free Software to sustain the infrastructure everyone
  is building upon. A discussion which, in our venture capital driven tech
  world, mostly evolves around <em>financing</em> as a means for getting
  resources. Who can/should pay whom, to develop Free Software and how. I would
  like to add another view at funding, one that in my opinion has way more to do
  with Free Software ecosystem than cold, hard cash: collaboration of free
  people.
</p>

<h2>Freedom and what you make of it</h2>
<p>
  The ability to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software. This
  is the essence of it, without these fundamental rights, software is not Free
  Software. And these fundamentals imply a purpose: Freedom, the ability to do
  as one wills. To do to software as one wills.
</p>

<p>
  As always, what people make of their freedom is up to them. Some go an preach
  about it, most ignore it, some use it for their personal gain. However, it's
  undeniable that the Free Software movement has entailed a community of
  systematic world wide collaboration. In software development, and I would
  argue in many other aspects of todays life. We all know the examples of
  hundreds of developers hacking together on Linux, thousands of authors on
  Wikipedia per month, millions of pictures in the creative commons and so on.
  Obviously, if you give people the freedom to do as they want, many of them are
  inspired to work together for the common benefit. And because Free Software
  entails collaboration and collaboration is about individuals, making projects
  sustainable has many dimensions. Money is one.
</p>

<h2>Challenges and what you do about them</h2>
<p>
  Of course there are many things going wrong today with making Free
  Software projects sustainable. For instance a growing imbalance between
  developers and users (<a href="https://coderanger.net/funding-foss/">Noah
  Kantrowitz</a>), that developers think they are not getting fairly compensated
  (<a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/open-source-work/">Ryan Bigg</a>) or
  that everybody is waiting for someone else to do something
  (<a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/sustainable-maintenance.html">Marijn
  Haverbeke</a>). Contributor burn-out. There are many, many more.
</p>
<p>
  The solutions to these shortcomings, discussed in the past months, most exclusively focus on
  monetizing work. Be it through business models, crowd funding, grants and
  other forms of injecting money into the equasion. In a recent piece, <a
  href="https://medium.com/@nayafia/how-i-stumbled-upon-the-internet-s-biggest-blind-spot-b9aa23618c58">Nadia
  Eghbal</a> even argues that somehow venture capital must flow back because all
  of the VC funded software companies somehow base their work on Free Software.
  <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/is-npm-worth-26mm">Steve Klabnik</a>
  thinks this is already happening. Here is the thing: Money will buy you
  people who contribute, sure thing. But is it money for contributions that made
  the present? For sure not. Collaborative contributions are the currency of Free
  Software.

<h2>People and how you treat them</h2>
<p>
  People have made Free Software as big as it is. <em>Active contributor
  communities</em>. Humans from all over the world, with different talents,
  levels of expertise and cultural backgrounds collaborating. All with their own
  motivations. Some want to learn from others, some scratch their itch,
  some want to train their skills, some want to boost their resume, some contribute
  on behalf of a company, some just try to avoid being bored on a Saturday afternoon. If your project
  does not actively channel <em>all</em> of these ambitions into contributions,
  if it does not organize the collaboration, if it is not offering shared
  responsibility and if it does not attract new contributors <b>it's doing
  something wrong</b>.
</p>
<p>
  An individual/company slapping a license onto code, uploading
  it to github, merging pull-requests and answering issues is not making a
  sustainable Free Software project. Yet this is what many do today.
</p>
<p>
  If you look at the most prominent examples of the software people worry about,
  <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisstokelwalker/the-internet-is-being-protected-by-two-guys-named-st">openssl</a>
  or <a
  href="http://www.informationweek.com/it-life/ntps-fate-hinges-on-father-time/d/d-id/1319432">NTP</a>,
  they are failed communities. They disintegrated to a point where collaboration
  ceased to exist, the remainaing people were not able to do anything to change
  this (I'm sure they tried hard) and in the end something bad happened, and now
  they are clearly not sustained. Now we all can throw some bucks together to
  keep developers developing but that wont make those projects sustainable Free
  Software communities. In my opinion paying for contributions is to capitulate
  in the face of to the task of building a sustainable community. There are
  other things which are more important.
</p>

<h2>Fund Free Software without money</h2>
<p>
  I guess the most obvious way to fund Free Software projects without money is
  to contribute in any way possible for you, duuhh. But apart from that I think
  there are more things we as the Free Software community at large can do
  better.
</p>
<p>
  In my opinion it's time we help each other to organize collaboration. We need
  to share best pratices about creating sustainable contributor communities that
  attract new people.
</p>
<p>
  We also should be more upfront with each other when we notice communities
  failing. I have contributed code to NTP a couple of years ago and didn't care
  that it was such a bleak place. Someone merged my patches, I was off again. In
  retrospecitve this feels like not telling someone their flap is open.
</p>
<p>
  I also think that we need to do better with copyleft project resources. We
  have the choice between 27 different C++ compilers but if you're looking
  for marketing materials, web site themes or templates of contributor
  guidelines you will draw mostly blanks. Convincing prospective users and
  contributors that our Free Software does something significantly better than
  the competition is very important, yet we leave each other hanging with this.
</p>
<h2>Now go do something</h2>
<p>
  Luckily somewhere Free Software people already have started with all of this. There is
  the <a href="http://www.communityleadershipforum.com">community leadership
  forum</a> where you can talk about all the aspects of your community.
  <a href="https://opensource.com/">opensource.com</a> curates a blog of
  best practices. Designers started to rally
  around <a href="http://opensourcedesign.net/">opensourcedesign.net</a>.
  People all over start to address the obvious
  <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/">diversity</a> problem our community has.
  Next month (July 2016) there is a conference to talk with other Free Software people about
  <a href="http://www.osfeels.com/">Open Source &amp; Feelings</a> and I'm sure
  there is more going on out there.
</p>
<p>
  What do you think about financing Free Software projects? Are you going to do
  something about making Free Software sustainable?
