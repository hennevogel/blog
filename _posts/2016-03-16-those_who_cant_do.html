title: '10 Tips for Mentoring #FreeSoftware Development'
---

<p>
  I believe that one of the most important tasks for a Free Software hacker is to
  bring into the community new people with new perspectives, backgrounds and
  fresh ideas. That's why I try to make contributing to my own projects as
  beginner friendly as possible, that's also the reason I frequently mentor
  people who take their first steps in developing Free Software with programs
  such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google's</a>,
  or <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Just recently I had the opportunity to implement a mentoring program
  (hey <a href="https://101.opensuse.org/">101</a>)
  for one of the Free Software communities I'm participating in
  (hey <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a>) together with a couple
  of friends (hey <a href="https://github.com/ChrisBr/">Chris</a> &amp;
   <a href="http://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/">Cornelius</a>).
  That adventure required me to think about what I find important
  about the whole process. I'd like to share those thoughts with you. Here are
  my 10 Tips for Mentoring Free Software development.
</p>

<div id="more"></div>

<h2>1. Put your Mentee First</h2>
<p>
  I believe in putting the mentees needs first. When I mentor someone
  I'll make an extra effort to place myself in their position. Empathize!
  Understanding preferences, requirements and circumstances is important.
  I try hard to comprehend where the mentee comes from and what I need
  to do to get them to contribute to Free Software. Mentoring is about their,
  not about my needs, nor the project's I mentor for.
</p>

<h2>2. Build a Relationship</h2>
<p>
  The most important goal is that you build a relationship based on trust and
  respect with the mentee. Without this, I believe, everything else you'll do is
  in vein. Newcomers are overwhelmed and insecure about their skills and it's
  your job to take that fear from them. Because fear is the path to the dark
  side! It's the fun times together with you that will matter most to them later
  on, not so much what code fu-fu you have taught them.
</p>
<p>
  Do not take this lightly. Relationships do not just happen, they need ongoing
  effort and attention, especially during the early stages. I find that the
  consistency of the relationship is what's most important. Talking as often
  as you can, finding a regular schedule where you meet and sticking to it is
  absolutely necessary, build a routine together.
</p>

<h2>3. Be a role model</h2>

</p>
<p>
  This might sound like a weird thing from the 60s and it makes most people
  uncomfortable but you need to be a role model for your mentee. Free Software
  development is as much about behavior in a community, knowing what you want,
  and the ability to convey this to others as it is about pointers, gcc macros
  and git command line options. You need to ensure that your mentee can follow
  your example and that you're not passing on your bad habits. You are
  responsible for developing the competence AND character of the mentee.
</p>

<h2>4. Lead</h2>
<p>
  Getting into Free Software development can be an overwhelming and daunting
  endeavor. Precise, reasonable and well-thought-out goals provide a path on which
  your mentee can take one step after the other into this strange new world.
  It's your duty that the goals and expectations for the project are actionable,
  fit your mentees needs and are technically sound. You lead the way.
</p>
<h2>5. Audit</h2>
<p>
  I find it important to understand and communicate where the project is
  and how the it progresses. Setting up regular milestones that I review and
  celebrate together with my mentee provide the opportunity to check and correct
  the course the mentee is following.
</p>
<h2>6. Applaud</h2>
<p>
  As a grumpy German this is a tricky one for me. But anyhow I think it's
  important to sharpen your senses for your mentees personal achievements.
  You recall the excitement the first time you succeeded in setting up the
  development environment? Remember how invincible you felt once you finally got
  a hold of git? The time of your first merged pull-request? Now for you and me
  those things first happened a decade ago and all of this is just the daily
  grind. For the mentee it's super duper exiting. Make sure you recognize and
  acknowledge those achievements. Praise.
</p>
<blockquote>
  “In the best, the friendliest and simplest relations flattery or praise is necessary, just as grease is necessary to keep wheels turning. ”
― Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace
</blockquote>
<h2>7. Collaborate</h2>
<p>
  Whatever challenge you face, remember you are not alone. You mingle on
  the shoulders of giants together with many other mentors. Make sure you share
  your experience, your ideas and your problems with them. All of you strive to
  reach the same goal: getting people into Free Software. Make sure you work
  together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as part of our worldwide
  community.
</p>
<h2>8. Commit</h2>
<p>
  Mentoring requires time, effort and endurance. It will cost you some
  evening you wanted to go out with your friends, at least an hour every
  day and a lot of nerves because you explain things, that are obvious to
  you, over and over again. If you are not sure that you are willing to do
  this then it's probably better that you don't do it.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand mentoring will give you the satisfaction of being a
  positive influence in the life of someone else. You will see a new
  contributor grow into the Free Software community and you will achieve results
  that matter. You will also get the opportunity to learn  something together
  and sometimes even making a new friend for life.
</p>
<h2>9. Adapt, be agile</h2>

</p>
<p>
  The only thing that is constant is change! You need to adapt your plan,
  milestones, time line, the technical details, your behavior and
  attitude during your time. Respond to change, help your mentee to do
  the same. Be open, courageous, and committed.
</p>
<h2>10. Don't follow my advise, form your own opinion</h2>
<p>
  All of this is just my opinion and there are many awesome resources about
  mentoring in general and about mentoring for Free Software development
  in particular out there. Don't trust me, inform yourself and make up
  your own opinion. Here are some pointers:
