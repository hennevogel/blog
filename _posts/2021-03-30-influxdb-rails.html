title: Measure twice, instrument once with influxdb-rails!
description: A blog post about the Ruby on Rails APM with influxdb-rails
---

<p>
  Now that we learned how truly magnificent <code>ActiveSupport::Notifications</code> is in the previous post,
  let's explore a RubyGem <a href="https://bruckmayer.net/">Chris</a>, others and me have built around this: influxdb-rails.
  Together with some other awesome Free Software, it will help you to deep dive into and understand your Ruby on Rails
  application performance.

<h2>Application Performance Monitoring (APM)</h2>
<p>
  I'm not sure we have to discuss this at all anymore, but here is why I think I need application performance
  monitoring for my Ruby on Rail apps: I'm an expert in using the software I hack. Hence I always travel the happy
  path, cleverly and unconsciously avoid the pitfalls, use it with forethought of the underlying architecture.
  Because of that, I usually <b>think</b> my app is fast: <a href="https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/perceived-performance">perceived performance</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <blockquote>
    It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.
    â€“ Henry David Thoreau
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  That is why I need someone to correct that bias for me, in black and white.
</p>

<h2>Free Software APM</h2>

<p>
  The good folks at <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> bring the instrumentation framework.
  <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/about/">InfluxData</a> deliver a time series database.
  <a href="https://grafana.com/about/team/">Grafana Labs</a> make a dashboard builder. All we need to do, as so often,
  is to plug Free Software together: SUCCESS!
</p>

<h3>InfluxDB + Grafana == ðŸ§¨</h3>

<p>
  I assume your Rails development environment is already running on 127.0.0.0:300. Getting InfluxDB and Grafana is a matter
  of pulling containers these days. You can use this simple <code>docker-compose</code> configuration for running them locally
  too.
</p>

{% highlight yaml %}
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  influx:
    image: influxdb:1.7
    environment:
      - INFLUXDB_DB=rails
      - INFLUXDB_USER=root
      - INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=root
      - INFLUXDB_READ_USER=grafana
      - INFLUXDB_READ_USER_PASSWORD=grafana
    volumes:
      - influxdata:/var/lib/influxdb
    ports:
      - 8086:8086
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:7.4.5
    ports:
      - 4000:3000
    depends_on:
      - influx
    volumes:
      - grafanadata:/var/lib/grafana
volumes:
  influxdata:
  grafanadata:
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  A courageous <code>docker-compose up</code> will boot things and you can access Grafana at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000">http://127.0.0.1:4000</a> (user: admin / password: admin).
  To read data from the InfluxDB container in Grafana, leave the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/datasources">/datasources</a>
  InfluxDB defaults alone and configure:
</p>

{% highlight shell %}
URL: http://influx:8086
Database: rails
User: grafana
Password: grafana
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>influxdb-rails: ðŸª¢ things together</h3>
<p>
  The <code>influxdb-rails</code> RubyGem is the missing glue code for making your app report metrics into the InfluxDB.
  Plug it into your Rails app by adding it to your bundle.
</p>

{% highlight shell %}
bundler add influxdb-rails
```
bundle install
bundle exec rails generate influxdb
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The next time you boot your Rails dev-env it will start to measure the performance of your app. Now comes the interesting
  part, interpreting this data with Grafana.
</p>

<h2>Understanding Ruby on Rails Performance</h2>
<p>
  Every time you use your dev-env, <code>influxdb-rails</code> will write a plethora of performance data into InfluxDB.
  Let's look at one of the measurements so you get an idea of what's going on. You remember the <code>ActiveSupport::Notification</code>
  called <code>process_action.action_controller</code> from the previous post? Rails sends this message every time an action in
  your controller has finished. It includes performance data for this action.
</p>
<p>
  You should know this from somewhere: development.log! It contains the same information.
</p>

{% highlight shell %}
Started GET "/things" for 127.0.0.1 at 2021-03-25 15:20:14 +0100
...
Completed 200 OK in 5ms (Views: 4.1ms | ActiveRecord: 0.1ms | Allocations: 3514)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  <code>ThingsController#index</code> took 5ms to finish overall, 4.1ms of those 5 in rendering, 0.1ms in querying the database.
  You find the same data for every request you make in your InfluxDB. Head over to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/explore">http://127.0.0.1:4000/explore</a>
  and let Grafana plot it for you.
</p>

<div class="img">
  {% asset 'posts/grafana-process_action.png' alt='A Grafana Panel plot' class='img-responsive img-center' %}
</div>

<p>
  Only want to see how your views are performing? Change the <code>field</code> from <code>controller</code> to <code>view</code>.
  Magic ðŸª„ But this is only one out of many different ways to look at this measurement. All of the panels below use this one
  measurement and the data it brings to visualize controller actions.
</p>

<div class="img">
  {% asset 'posts/grafana-process_action-panels.jpg' alt='Many different Grafana panel plots' class='img-responsive img-center' %}
</div>

<p>And this is only one measurement, <code>influxdb-rails</code> reports around a dozen.
  Now I could send you off your way to learn about
  <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-rails">ALL.</a>
  <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/">THE.</a>
  <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/getting-started/">SOFTWARE.</a>
  involved, but that would be mean wouldn't it?
</p>

<h3>Ruby on Rails Dashboards</h3>
<p>
  We, the Free Software community, are in this together right? We collaborate on Ruby on Rails. We work together to make the
  InfluxDB better. We cooperate to improve Grafana. Why not do the same for the dashboards to visualize Rails performance data?
  Let's collaborate! That is why we have build a couple of dashboards you can <a href="http://127.0.0.0:4000/dashboard/import">import</a>
  into your Grafana. Just copy and paste the URLs.
