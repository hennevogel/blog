<h2>So you think that you are not entitled to decide something?</h2>

<p>
  YOU ARE &gt; GO KICK ASS!
</p>

<p>
  Despite the fact that our community is around for some time we are a very young movement.
  We don't have much organization. No hierarchy, very little processes, no roles or functions,
  no directions and only very general rules. If you’re hesitant now and try not to stick your neck out,
  this community will fail.
</p>
<blockquote>
  You participate in a time where it’s <strong>only you</strong> that makes a difference.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Don’t be shy. You're a peach!
  Don’t be modest, <strong>KICK ASS!</strong>
</p>

<h2>Waiting for something “official”?</h2>
<p>
  THERE IS NO ONE OFFICIAL &gt; GO KICK ASS!
</p>
<p>
  There is only you and the people next to you. There is no one steering the Free Software community,
  there is only you pushing your topic. There is no mastermind behind all this, there is only you thinking
  about your thing. <strong>There is no management</strong>, there is only you running your things.
  If you do something it’s what Free Software does. If you decide something it’s what Free Software decides.
</p>
<p>
  Don't hesitate, just do it.
  Don’t wait, <strong>KICK ASS!</strong>
</p>

<h2>You’re worried about your idea being liked?</h2>
<p>
  THEY LOVE IT &gt; GO KICK ASS!
</p>

<p>
  Push for your goal. In this community we value others’ opinions.
  We value openness. We value critique. We do NOT value consensus. It’s nice if it happens, it makes
  you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside but <strong>consensus is not the prerequisite for action</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Try to incorporate the feedback you get as good as you can. Be open minded and willing to try new things.
  But also keep your goal in mind. You started with an idea on how to do something, don’t let the feedback
  kill your idea. Remember, there are always many people who just like your idea and don’t say anything.
</p>
<p>
  Don’t let the nay-sayers stop you, <strong>KICK ASS!</strong>
</p>
<h2>You're afraid of contradiction?</h2>
<p>
  WE ARE NOT A LOGICAL CONSISTENT COMMUNITY &gt; GO KICK ASS!
</p>
<p>
  We can have a team but no leader. We can have vim and emacs. We can be self-contradictory!
  Free Software consists of so many projects, ideas, values and people that they can’t possibly all be
  on the same page. <strong>You don’t need to prove to yourself or anyone else that you conform</strong>. There
  can be two or more things of the same kind even if they do exactly the same thing. 
<p>
  Don't buy into conformity. <strong>KICK ASS!</strong>
</p>
<h2>You are unsure about something?</h2>
<p>
TRY IT &gt; GO KICK ASS!
</p>
<p>
  Here we don’t think everything through to the end. We are playful!
  <strong>You need to release early, release often. Everything!</strong> Not only code but your frustrations,
  ideas and plans also. That means that people will see your mistakes. People will spot your inconsistencies.
  People will get on your nerves with their own ideas about your stuff. But it also means you don’t have be
  100% correct, don’t have to be 100% ready and you don’t have to do 100% yourself.
</p>
<p>
  Put everything out there, <strong>KICK ASS!</strong>
</p>
<h2>You Fear Falling Down?</h2>
<p>
  More often then we like it, the things we dream of, the ideas we come up with, the lines of code we produce STINK.
  And that’s okay, <strong>shit happens</strong>. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes, nobody will think less of you.
  In this community people will scrape you off the ground and put you on your feet again. Failure is punished by a pat
  on the back and a smile. Don’t doubt that for a second.
</p>
<p>
  Fail and <strong>KICK ASS!</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
  Stop contemplating!<br />
  Stop holding back!<br />
  Stop worrying!<br />

<h1>KICK ASS!</h1>
