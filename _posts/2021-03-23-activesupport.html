title: ActiveSupport::Notifications is rad!
description: A blog post about the Ruby on Rails instrumentation with ActiveSupport::Notifications
---

<p>
  One of the lesser known parts of rails core is the ActiveSupport instrumentation framework.
  <code>ActiveSupport::Notifications</code> includes all the things you need to implement pub-sub in Rails.
  Pub-Sub is a software architecture where you publish (send) a message without being specific about who should
  receive this message, if anything. Fire and forget.
</p>
<p>  
  Receiving a message, and doing something with it, "just" requires you to subscribe to it. Because the publisher doesn't
  need to know about the subscribers (it's decoupled), this provides nice opportunities for scale. For instance, the amount
  of subscribers to an event is just limited by your resources.
</p>
<p>
  Let's explore the joyful shenanigans of this.

<h2>Publish &amp; Subscribe</h2>

<p>
  There is an instrumentation message emitted from <code>ActionController</code> that includes interesting data
  about the things happening in your controller action. Let's explore this.
</p>
<p>
  If you don't have a Ruby on Rails app at hand, just setup a minimal one with
</p>
<p>  
  <code>rails new --minimal</code>
</p>

<p>
  Add this code into an initializer
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
# config/initializers/instrumentation_subscriber.rb

# What happens in ActionController?
module ActionController
  class InstrumentationSubscriber < ActiveSupport::Subscriber
    attach_to :action_controller

    def process_action(message)
      Rails.logger.debug "Instrumentation #{message.name} Received!"
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Boot the app (<code>rails server</code>), visit <a href="http://127.0.0.0:3000">http://127.0.0.0:3000</a> and you'll
  see the new log lines. So what? What's the difference to calling <code>Rails.logger</code> in an action or in a callback
  inside your controller? Why is <code>ActiveSupport::Notifications</code> fabulous?
</p>

<h2>ActiveSupport::Notifications Scales</h2>
<p>
  First, as explained in the intro, the main advantage is that the publisher is decoupled from the subscriber. For instance,
  you can have more than one subscriber listening to <code>process_action.action_controller</code>.
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
# config/initializers/slowlog_subscriber.rb

module ActionController
  class SlowlogSubscriber < ActiveSupport::Subscriber
    attach_to :action_controller

    def process_action(message)
      return if message.duration <= 10

      controller_location = [message.payload[:controller], message.payload[:action]].join("#") # -> ThingsController#something
      Rails.logger.debug "#{controller_location} was slow (#{message.duration}ms)" 
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  You are free to organize this however you want. Decouple publisher/subscriber in different files, chronological or
  even in different threads.
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
# config/initializers/poor_mans_background_job_subscriber.rb

module ActionController
  class PMBGJSubscriber < ActiveSupport::Subscriber
    include Concurrent::Async

    attach_to :action_controller

    def process_action(message)
      async.background_job(message)
    end

    def background_job(message)
      # ...do something expensive with the message in a thread
      sleep(60)
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>ActiveSupport::Notifications is everywhere today</h2>
<p>
  Second, and you probably already guessed this from the example, what makes this most awesome are the ready made
  messages that are already published <b>today</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Rails for instance uses <code>ActiveSupport::Notifications</code> to publish close to 50(!) different instrumentation events
  that include data about your application. Data ranging from the HTTP status code of your requests, over which partials
  were rendered, to more esoteric measurements like the byte range attempted to be read from your ActiveStorage service.
  Check the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html">instrumentation guide</a>
  for all the dirty secrets.
</p>

<h2>ActiveSupport::Notifications is easily extendible</h2>
<p>
  Last but not least, you can not only listen to messages others publish, you can publish messages to yourself.
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument "cool_thing_happened.my_app", {some: :data} do
  MyApp.do_cool_thing(true)
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Okay, you're convinced I hope! Now what do people do with <code>ActiveSupport::Notifications</code> out in the world?
</p>

<h2>Application Health/Performance Monitoring (A*M)</h2>
<p>
  Ever wondered how your metrics get to sentry, new relic, datadog or skylight? You guessed it, via <code>ActiveSupport::Notifications</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Now if the main work, publishing tons of messages through a pub-sub architecture, is already done by Rails, surely there are
  non SaaS (a.k.a. Free Software) options to display this data right? Turns out there aren't really. While evaluating A*M for some
  of my projects (especially Open Build Service) we came across this gap and started to fill it.
