title: 'Distributing Free Software: Herding Cats'
---

<p>
  The basic challenge of distributing Free Software is compiling that awesome
  open source code into machine code for different Linux distributions so it's
  easily consumable for users. Sounds simple, but it isn't. If you look at the
  dependencies of a typical Free Software project you will find thousands of
  other projects in the stack. They build on top of each other, have functional
  dependencies, sometimes they are interdependent, they conflict with each other
  and what not. In short: Building Free Software is like herding cats. And
  rightfully users of the software expect a steady, well behaved, streamlined
  herd of cats! The <a href="http://openbuildservice.org">Open Build Service (OBS)</a>
  is the tool which makes this possible, it helps Free Software distributors to
  <strong>automatically and consistently build binary packages</strong>
  from free and open source code.
</p>

<div id="more"></div>

<p>
  It goes like this: Engineers upload source code and build instructions to the
  OBS and the system compiles that into binary packages for different
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distribution versions</a>
  and different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">CPU architectures</a>.
  The build instructions say how to compile the source code into machine code,
  defines the dependencies and the conflicting capabilities the software has in
  relation to other software, itemizes which files are needed to run it, and a
  whole lot of other meta data. The job of the OBS is to interpret all this
  information, to provide a build environment matching the requirements, the
  execution of the build, and of course the reporting of the outcome.
</p>

<p>
  The end result are multiple binary packages out of one single source. The twist
  is: If other software depends on the package in some way, the OBS will trigger
  a rebuild of the depending package afterward. This ensures that changes
  propagate through the whole stack and that the user gets a consistent product
  to install.
</p>

<h2>Updates: Nobody is perfect.</h2>

</p>

<p>
  Sadly, software is sometimes defective and people make mistakes.  Nobody is
  perfect.  That's why the second basic service a Free Software distributor
  delivers to its users is the art of exchanging pieces without breaking the
  whole: Updates. Your distributor does not want to interrupt you in going about
  your business, and to be able to do this he needs to <strong>reproduce the
  software builds</strong> at any given time in the long lifetime of the software.
</p>

<p>
  The OBS helps distributors to achieve this by tracking who has made changes,
  when changes are made, and what has changed. The OBS also helps by utilizing a
  clean, virtualized build environment. This is how it goes: When an engineer
  triggers a build in the OBS by changing the software in it, the system saves
  the current state, gathers all the dependencies and kicks off a virtualized
  environment to execute the build. As the information on how to assemble the
  build environment is contained in the software and as all dependent software
  gets rebuilt too it makes every build reproducible.
</p>

<p>
  And if something is reproducible it is predictable and that is what distributors
  aim for. If you can predict how all of the software projects in your stack
  influence each other, you can make sure that a change to a single piece can be
  managed through all of its dependencies, ensuring that the whole system of
  software continues to work after a change. This is how the OBS helps you as a
  user because updates from the OBS don't get in the way of your business.
</p>

<h2>Collaboration: Unity is strength</h2>

</p>

<p>
  Now the software isn't the only herd of cats that needs taming. Each of the
  thousands of software projects is maintained by one or more developers that
  collaborate with each other, that's a whole bunch of awesome people! And this is
  the third basic challenge a Free Software distributor solves for its users. It
  brings together people who <strong>collaborate on the integration of free and
  open source software</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The OBS formalizes this collaboration into work flows that all engineers
  utilize. Everybody is using the same way to submit new software, to update
  existing software to a new version, to submit bug fixes and features. Everyone
  is using the same means to branch, study, change, and improve the software.
</p>

<p>
  OBS simply helps Free Software engineers to harness the power of the open
  source development model. And this also helps the users because they get a
  tightly integrated software solution.
</p>

<h2>There is more...</h2>

<p>
  This is how Free Software distributors utilizes the Open Build Service for
  the benefit of the users: Build binary packages for a wide range of
  distributions and architectures from source code in an automatic, consistent,
  reproducible and collaborative way.
</p>
<p>
  But there is more: OBS itself is free software. You can run, copy,
  distribute, study, change and improve it. The source code and the developers are
  on <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service">github</a>. As Free
  Software, it is able to keep up with the ever-evolving ecosystem, which
  constantly produces new distributions, new package formats, new architectures,
  software, standards and tools. At the current time, OBS supports more than 20
  different distributions, half a dozen architectures and three different package
  formats. It can cryptographically sign your software and products, different
  instances of OBS can connect to each other and OBS can be used in conjunction
  with source code revision systems like git/github in continuous integration work
  flows.
</p>

<h2>Do. Or do not. There is no try.</h2>

<p>
  Enough talk, let's get practical! You have Free Software that you want to
  make available? Here is a nice video tutorial on how you can utilize the
  <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">Open Build Service reference server</a>
  which is freely available for developers to build packages for the most popular
  Linux distributions including openSUSE, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise.

  That's how you can build and distribute binary packages for a wide range of
  distributions and architectures with the Open Build Service. Enjoy!
