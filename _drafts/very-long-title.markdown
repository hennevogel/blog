An h1 header
============

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

<div id="more"></div>

An h2 header
------------
Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

instead of indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

You can optionally mark the delimited block for syntax highlight:

```ruby
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```

### An h3 header ###
Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:
      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils
 2. Boil some water.
 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
document](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

Tables can look like this:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

A horizontal rule follows.

and images can be specified like so:
